# Life Story Voicebox - Product Requirements Document
*Elderly User Experience Improvements*

## Executive Summary
Transform Life Story Voicebox into a **dignified, accessible platform** that empowers elderly users (70-90+) to effortlessly preserve their life stories with confidence and joy. Current technical foundation is solid, but significant UX improvements needed for elderly accessibility.

## Target Users
- **90-year-old grandmother**: WhatsApp user, basic tech comfort, values simplicity
- **70-year-old father**: More tech-savvy, appreciates efficiency and control

## Critical Bug Fixes & Enhancements

### **Recording System Issues**
1. **Save Without Pause Bug**: Fix error that occurs when clicking Save button during active recording without pausing first
   - **Root Cause**: Save function expects recording to be in 'paused' state
   - **Solution**: Auto-pause recording when Save is clicked, or prevent Save button during active recording
   - **Priority**: Critical - breaks core functionality

2. **Long Recording Truncation**: Investigate and fix audio truncation in longer recordings
   - **Issue**: MediaRecorder may be cutting long recordings or losing audio chunks
   - **Investigation Areas**: Chunk collection logic, blob assembly, MediaRecorder timeslice parameter
   - **Solution**: Ensure complete audio capture regardless of recording duration
   - **Priority**: High - affects recording quality

3. **Content Generation Enhancement**: Expand AI-generated content options
   - **Current**: Basic summary only
   - **Requested**: Both short summary AND detailed autobiography
   - **Implementation**: Add toggle or separate sections for different content lengths
   - **Priority**: Medium - enhances user value

## Critical Improvements Needed

### 1. **Visual Accessibility Overhaul**

#### Font & Readability Issues
**Current Problems:**
- Base fonts too small (14-18px) for aging eyes
- Insufficient contrast in secondary text
- Missing high contrast mode

**Requirements:**
```css
/* Elderly-Optimized Typography */
--text-base-elderly: 20px;        /* Minimum readable size */
--text-lg-elderly: 24px;          /* Comfortable reading */
--text-xl-elderly: 28px;          /* Important content */
--line-height-elderly: 1.8;       /* Generous spacing */
--font-weight-minimum: 500;       /* Better contrast */
```

**Implementation:**
- Add accessibility panel with font size controls (100%, 125%, 150%, 200%)
- Implement high contrast mode toggle
- Respect system accessibility preferences

#### Button & Touch Target Enhancement
**Current Issues:**

### 2. **Cognitive Simplification**
